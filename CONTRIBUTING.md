## Contributing to the tutorial

We welcome contributions! This document outlines how you can contribute to the project, including how to report issues, create pull requests, and follow coding style guidelines.

### Getting Started

*   **Fork this repository:** Create a fork of this repository. This allows you to make your own changes and submit them for review.
*   **Clone your fork:** Clone your forked repository to your local machine.

**If you're new to Git and GitHub, there are many resources available online to help you get started.**

### Reporting Issues

If you encounter a bug (errors) or have a suggestion for improvement, please create an issue on GitHub. Here are some guidelines for creating a good issue report:

*   **Describe the issue clearly:** Explain the problem you're facing in detail. Include screenshots or code snippets if possible.
*   **State the expected behavior:** Describe what you expect the code to do versus what's actually happening.
*   **Include relevant context:** Mention any specific versions of libraries or your operating system that might be relevant.

### Creating Pull Requests

If you'd like to fix an issue or add a new feature, you can create a pull request. Here's how:

1.  **Create a new branch:** Create a new branch on your local fork for your changes.
2.  **Make your changes:** Implement your bug fix or feature addition in your branch.
3.  **Commit your changes:** Commit your changes with descriptive commit messages.
4.  **Push your changes to your fork:** Push your branch to your remote fork on GitHub.
5.  **Create a pull request:** Create a pull request from your branch to the main branch of the upstream repository.

**Before submitting a pull request, please ensure the following:**

*   **Code Style:** This repo is not meant to be production ready, and is more academic/prototype in nature. With all that said, we encourage your submission to be similar to the existing style, or even better: follow PEP 8 style guidelines for Python code.
*   **Your code is well-tested:** We don't expect full unit-tests, but try your best to make sure your code works as expected, and comment as much as possible. 
*   **Your pull request description is clear:** Briefly describe the changes you made and their purpose.
